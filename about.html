    <h1 class="site-title">About</h1>
    <p>Stutter Step is a boredom project to help me and others get better at
      League of Legends. In particular, it aims to help improve your
      kiting/orb-walking/stutter-stepping ability through letting you optimize
      the amount of time spent attacking versus moving.</p>

    <h2 id="settings">Settings</h2>
    <p>This project has settings that you can configure to your taste.</p>
    <h3 id="keybinds">Keybinds</h3>
    <p>You're free to change the keybinds from their defaults to whatever it is
      that you are comfortable with.</p>
    <h3 id="champion-stats">Champion Stats</h3>
    <p>Each champion comes with their own base attack speed, but also their own
      windup time and windup modifier. You can get these numbers from the
      Attack Speed table under the LoL Fandom page for that champion. For
      instance, <a href="https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Ashe">Senna</a>'s
      numbers are as follow.

    <p>You can use the following mapping to put the numbers in the right place.</p>
    <table>
      <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Setting</th>
        <th>Fandom Table</th>
        <th>E.g. Senna</th>
      </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th>Base AS</th>
        <td>
          <i>Base AS</i> + Any level-based scaling. <br>
          <i>e.g.</i> Jhin (0.625 &mdash; 0.944)
        </td>
        <td>0.625</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Total AS</th>
        <td>
          Any number you'd like. This is the final AS after any scaling from
          items. For Jhin, this would be the same as his Base AS, since he can't
          build any AS whatsoever.
        </td>
        <td><i>any</i></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Windup</th>
        <td>
          <i>Attack windup</i> as a decimal. 15% &rarr; 0.15
        </td>
        <td>0.34375</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Windup Mod</th>
        <td>
          <i>Attack windup (mod.)</i> or 1 for champions that don't have
          this value.
        </td>
        <td>0.6</td>
      </tr>
      </tbody>

    <h2 id="the-math">The Math</h2>
    <p>Stutter Step implements the formulas that Riot uses to determine the
      optimal attack-to-move ratio, and compares your actions against it,
      calculating the "lost" time, i.e. time that could have been spent winding
      up an attack or moving.</p>
    <p>See <a target="blank" href="https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Basic_attack#Attack_speed">
      this page</a> for the exact equation. It's much more convoluted than you'd
      imagine.</p>
    <pre>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</pre>

    <h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
    <p>This application maintains two timers, total time and lost time. Total
      time, predictably, is the amount of time since the start of the current
      session. Lost time is the difference between the optimal ratio of
      attack-to-movement and your achieved ratio.</p>
    <p>It also charts a line beneath the optimal ratio that shows your achieved
      ratio.</p>
